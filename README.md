- **Mock Data Integration:** Simulated realistic threat scenarios (no real security data needed)
- **Hot Reload:** Instant updates during development with Vite
- **Component-based Architecture:** Modular design for easy customization
- **No Dependencies:** Works completely offline - great for presentations!

### üåê Production Mode (Real Wazuh Integration)
Enterprise-grade deployment with actual security monitoring:
- **Real Threat Data:** Connected to actual Wazuh SIEM collecting real security events
- **Global Accessibility:** Deployed on AWS for worldwide access
- **Static-Dynamic Hybrid:** Fast loading with real-time data updates
- **Cost-Effective:** Enterprise-grade scalability for less than $10/month

### üîç What Happens with Real Data:

1. **Wazuh Collects:** Your EC2 instances run Wazuh agents monitoring for suspicious activity
2. **Raw Storage:** All security logs go to `wazuh-raw` S3 bucket (think of it as a security camera recording)
3. **Smart Analysis:** Lambda functions analyze patterns and detect threats, storing results in `wazuh-results` bucket
4. **Dashboard Display:** Your React app fetches this processed intelligence and shows it beautifully
5. **Real-time Updates:** Every time you refresh, you get the latest threat analysis

## üìä Real Threat Data Examples

Here's what the dashboard shows when connected to real Wazuh data:

### üö® Actual Security Events Detected:
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "summary": "Multiple SSH brute-force attempts detected from 3 different IPs",
    "total_logs": 1247,
    "normal_logs": 1156,
    "abnormal_logs": 91
  },
  "real_attacks": [
    {
      "src_ip": "192.168.1.225",
      "attack_type": "SSH Brute Force", 
      "confidence": 85,
      "mitre_id": "T1021.004",
      "description": "Repeated failed SSH login attempts"
    },
    {
      "src_ip": "192.168.2.25", 
      "attack_type": "Credential Stuffing",
      "confidence": 80,
      "mitre_id": "T1110.001",
      "description": "Multiple password attempts on different accounts"
    }
  ]
}
```

### üîç What This Means in Plain English:
- **SSH Brute Force:** Someone trying to guess passwords to log into your servers
- **Confidence 85%:** The AI is 85% sure this is a real attack (not false alarm)
- **MITRE T1021.004:** Official cybersecurity classification for SSH attacks
- **Source IPs:** The actual computer addresses where attacks came from

### üìà Dashboard Visualization:
- **Charts show:** Attack trends over time
- **Maps display:** Geographic location of attackers
- **Alerts list:** Each individual security event
- **Recommendations:** What to do about each threat
